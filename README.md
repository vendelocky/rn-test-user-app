### Notes
This app is built with React Native and have met all the acceptance criterias provided in the technical assessment docs with some additional functionalities for the better of the UI/UX.

I have tried as best as I could within the estimation timeline I provided 😄

Thanks for the opportunity and looking forward for the review result! 🤝
